hey EvEloBE here so i didnt actually do anything i just made a new guildID schema in mongodb/schema.js and i went and found a video thats easy to understand 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZhy9Sjeom8 this is the video. we already have the half of it done so you have to do only a little bit of code and the reason i didnt do it myself is so you can do it and understand it better
:) if anything DM me on discord


// thanks !
